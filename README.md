# Week1---Turtle
Week 1 assignment - Advanced Python 

Based on the turtle object, create a method called TurtleFlower, that uses the turtle location to draw a square, then turn some degrees and draw another square and so on to end up with what looks like flower petals. Do this by writing a function drawFlower that uses numOfSquares as a parameter, then draws repeated squares based on the parameter. You will need to calculate the angle to turn by based on the number of squares.

There are two more turtle functions we can use: begin_fill and end_fill. When begin_fill is activated it keeps track of where it started so when you call end_fill it knows to fill in the space covered by lines; Update the code of the square flower petals so the space is filled.

**Important** Make sure you have no floating code. All statements must be in a function. To get things started write a main function, then call it at the end.
